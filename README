Say Time
========

An Android application that provides a way for commuters to learn the current 
time by pressing the headset button on their phone. The application has been 
written to support Android 2.2 audio focus management and audio focus ducking. 

The application can be configured to provide a calculation of the duration 
between subsequent queries. The application can also, optionally, say the 
time at the top of the hour.
